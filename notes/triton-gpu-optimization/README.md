## 🎯 Recommended Learning Path

### Beginner → Intermediate
1. **Start with `pytorch-triton-basics.ipynb`**
   - Run all cells sequentially
   - Experiment with environment variables
   - Practice debugging techniques
   - Understand compilation overhead

### Intermediate → Advanced
2. **Progress to `triton-optimization.ipynb`**
   - Study each fusion pattern systematically
   - Analyze generated kernels
   - Run comprehensive benchmarks
   - Adapt patterns to your use cases

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- PyTorch with CUDA support (`torch >= 2.0`)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA capability
- Python environment with Jupyter support

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

After completing both notebooks, you will:
- Understand PyTorch's compilation system deeply
- Know how to optimize common neural network patterns
- Be able to debug and troubleshoot performance issues
- Have practical experience with kernel fusion
- Possess tools for systematic performance analysis

## 🔬 Experimental Structure

The notebooks follow a structured experimental approach:
- **Organized directories**: Each experiment creates its own directory
- **Kernel capture**: Generated Triton kernels are saved for analysis
- **Metadata tracking**: Comprehensive information about each experiment
- **Reproducible results**: Clear documentation of what was tested

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Navigate to the directory
cd notes/triton-gpu-optimization/

# Start with fundamentals
jupyter notebook pytorch-triton-basics.ipynb

# Then progress to advanced patterns
jupyter notebook triton-optimization.ipynb
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Run notebooks sequentially** - Each builds on previous concepts
2. **Experiment actively** - Modify patterns to test your own ideas
3. **Check generated directories** - Examine kernels and metadata
4. **Measure everything** - Use the benchmarking tools provided
5. **Start simple** - Master basics before attempting custom optimizations

## 📈 Performance Expectations

Typical speedups from kernel fusion:
- **LayerNorm + GELU**: 1.5-3x improvement
- **Softmax + Dropout**: 1.2-2x improvement  
- **RMSNorm**: 1.1-1.8x improvement
- **Custom patterns**: Varies based on complexity

*Results depend on hardware, tensor sizes, and specific workloads.*
