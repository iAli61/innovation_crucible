    "PyTorch's `torch.compile()` delivers 20-40% performance improvements in production, but only when applied correctly. This tutorial dissects Meta's TorchInductor compiler to show you exactly how PyTorch transforms your models into optimized GPU kernels—and when that transformation fails.\n",

    "\n",

    "### 🧠 Understanding PyTorch's Compilation Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `torch.compile()`, PyTorch's TorchInductor backend executes a six-stage transformation pipeline. Each stage contributes measurable latency, but understanding their specific functions enables precise optimization decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ The Six-Stage Pipeline: Technical Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 1: FX Graph Capture** 🔍\n",
    "PyTorch's `torch.fx` tracer records your model's execution as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each operation becomes a node, tensor flows become edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Process**: The tracer executes your model with symbolic tensors, intercepting every PyTorch operation via the `__torch_function__` protocol. This produces an FX Graph with nodes like `call_function(torch.ops.aten.add.Tensor, args=(x, y))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement**: Graph capture typically adds 10-50ms overhead depending on model complexity. You can observe this with `TORCH_LOGS=graph_breaks`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation**: Dynamic control flow breaks tracing. Conditional statements based on tensor values trigger \"graph breaks\" that fragment optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 2: Pattern-Based Graph Optimization** ⚡\n",
    "TorchInductor applies 47 distinct optimization passes, including operation fusion, constant folding, and memory layout transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concrete Example**: Your `LayerNorm → GELU → Scaling` sequence becomes a single fused kernel instead of three separate operations. This eliminates intermediate memory allocations and improves cache locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Transformations**:\n",
    "- `BatchNorm + ReLU` → Single fused kernel (saves ~30% memory bandwidth)\n",
    "- `Matrix Multiply + Bias Add` → GEMM with bias (reduces kernel launch overhead)\n",
    "- `Consecutive pointwise operations` → Single elementwise kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Impact**: Fusion reduces kernel launch overhead from ~5μs per operation to single kernel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 3: TorchInductor Backend Selection** 🎯\n",
    "For GPU operations, TorchInductor routes optimized operations to Triton kernel generation. CPU operations use C++ code generation with OpenMP parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection Logic**: Operations are classified as `compute_intensive` (benefits from Triton) or `memory_bound` (uses ATen fallback). Matrix operations, convolutions, and fused pointwise operations target Triton.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observable Behavior**: Set `TORCHINDUCTOR_VERBOSE=1` to see backend selection decisions in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 4: Triton Kernel Generation** 🔧\n",
    "TorchInductor generates Triton source code—a Python-like GPU programming language that compiles to CUDA/ROCm kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generated Code Structure**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@triton.jit\n",
    "def kernel_name(input_ptr, output_ptr, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n",
    "    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n",
    "    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n",
    "    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n",
    "    mask = offsets < n_elements\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Memory-coalesced loads\n",
    "    x = tl.load(input_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Fused computation\n",
    "    result = tl.math.fast_exp(x) / (1.0 + tl.math.fast_exp(x))  # Sigmoid\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Memory-coalesced stores  \n",
    "    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, result, mask=mask)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic Optimizations**: Triton handles memory coalescing, bank conflict avoidance, and register allocation without manual tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 5: CUDA Compilation** ⚙️\n",
    "Triton kernels compile to PTX (NVIDIA) or AMDGPU assembly using LLVM. This step has the highest latency—typically 100-500ms per unique kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compilation Command**: Internally equivalent to `nvcc -arch=sm_XX -O3` with additional Triton-specific optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Strategy**: Compiled kernels are cached by input shapes, data types, and operation signatures in `~/.triton/cache/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 6: Execution & Caching** 💾\n",
    "Compiled kernels execute with optimal grid/block dimensions determined by autotuning. Cache hits eliminate stages 1-5 entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Key Format**: `<operation_hash>_<input_shapes>_<dtypes>_<device_capability>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autotuning Process**: Triton benchmarks multiple BLOCK_SIZE configurations (32, 64, 128, 256) and selects the fastest for your specific hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎓 Performance Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline creates a specific cost-benefit profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Execution**: 50-500ms compilation overhead\n",
    "**Subsequent Executions**: 2-10x faster than uncompiled baseline\n",
    "**Break-even Point**: Typically 5-20 executions, depending on model complexity\n",

    "After running the compilation demonstration above, PyTorch has generated optimized GPU kernels behind the scenes. Now it's time to explore what was actually created!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Exploration Reveals:\n",
    "- **Kernel Cache Location**: Where PyTorch stores compiled kernels for reuse\n",
    "- **Generated Files**: The actual Triton kernel source code files\n",
    "- **Optimization Patterns**: How PyTorch fused operations and optimized memory access\n",
    "- **Triton Language Features**: Real examples of GPU programming constructs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Kernel Caching**: Why subsequent runs are fast - kernels are saved and reused\n",
    "- **Triton Patterns**: Look for `@triton.jit`, `tl.load`, `tl.store`, and `BLOCK_SIZE`\n",

    "Even with PyTorch's sophisticated compilation system, issues can arise. Let's explore common problems and their solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Compilation Failures**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Common error: Dynamic shapes\n",
    "RuntimeError: Cannot compile with dynamic shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution: Use torch.compile with dynamic=True or fix shapes\n",
    "compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, dynamic=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Performance Regressions**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Issue: Compiled version slower than baseline\n",
    "# Causes: Small models, wrong compilation mode, graph breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solutions:\n",
    "# 1. Try different modes\n",
    "compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, mode=\"reduce-overhead\")  # vs \"default\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Check for graph breaks\n",
    "with torch._dynamo.optimize(\"inductor\"):\n",
    "    result = fn(input)  # Will show graph break warnings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Memory Issues**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Issue: Out of memory during compilation\n",
    "# Solution: Reduce compilation scope or use checkpointing\n",
    "@torch.compile(mode=\"reduce-overhead\")\n",
    "def smaller_function(x):\n",
    "    # Break large functions into smaller ones\n",
    "    return partial_computation(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Unsupported Operations**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Issue: Some operations don't support compilation\n",
    "# Solution: Selective compilation or fallbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "class HybridModel(nn.Module):\n",
